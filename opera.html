  <br><p>[Scene—The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of
  Mount Olympus.  Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with
  ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen
  columns on the stage. Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of
  stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This
  should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to
  ascend and descend.<br>In the distance are the summits of adjacent
  mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which
  clears presently.  Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
  duty as fatigued with their night's work]</p>

  CHO.  Through the night, the constellations,
       Have given light from various stations.
       When midnight gloom falls on all nations,
       We will resume our occupations.

  SOLO. Our light, it's true, is not worth mention;
       What can we do to gain attention.
       When night and noon with vulgar glaring
       A great big moon is always flaring.

  During chorus, enter Diana, an elderly goddess. She is carefully
  wrapped up in cloaks, shawls, etc.  A hood is over her head, a
  respirator in her mouth, and galoshes on her feet. During the
  chorus, she takes these things off and discovers herself dressed
  in the usual costume of the Lunar Diana, the goddess of the moon.

  DIA. [shuddering] Ugh. How cold the nights are.  I don't know how
  it is, but I seem to feel the night air a good deal more than I
  used to. But it is time for the sun to be rising. [Calls] Apollo.

  AP. My dear sister, I don't envy you—though I remember when I
  did—but that was when I was a younger sun.  I don't think I'm
  quite well.  Perhaps a little change of air will do me good. I've
  a mind to show myself in London this winter. They'll be very glad
  to see me. No. I shan't go out today. I shall send them this
  fine, thick wholesome fog and they won't miss me.  It's the best
  substitute for a blazing sun—and like most substitutes, nothing
  at all like the real thing.

  <p>[Fog clears away and discovers the scene described. Hurried
  music. Mercury shoots up from behind precipice at the back of
  stage. He carries several parcels afterwards described.  He sits
  down, very much fatigued.]</p>

  MER. Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.

  DIA. You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the
  third time you've been out this week.

  MER. Well you're a nice one to blow me up for that.

  DIA. I can't help being out all night.

 
       Oh, I'm the celestial drudge,
       For morning to night I must stop at it.
       On errands all day I must trudge,
       And stick to my work til I drop at it.
       In summer I get up at one.
       (As a good-natured donkey I'm ranked for it.)
       then I go and I light up the sun.
       And Phoebus Apollo gets thanked for it.
       Well, well, it's the way of the world.
       And will be through all its futurity.
       Though noodles are baroned and earled,
       There's nothing for clever obscurity.

       I'm the slave of the Gods, neck and heels,
       And I'm bound to obey, though I rate at 'em.
       And I not only order their meals,
       But I cook 'em and serve'em and wait at 'em.
       Then I make all their nectar, I do.
       (What a terrible liquor to rack us is.)
       And whenever I mix them a brew,
       Why all the thanksgivings are Bacchus's.
       Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc.....

       The reading and writing I teach.
       And spelling-books many I've edited.
       And for bringing those arts within reach,
       That donkey Minerva gets credited.
       Then I scrape at the stars with a knife,
       And plate-powder the moon (on the days for it).
       And I hear all the world and his wife
       Awarding Diana the praise for it.
       Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc....

    JUP. Well, well. Don't be hard on the lad.  To tell you the
  truth, I'm not sure that he's far wrong. Don't let it go any
  further, but, between ourselves, the sacrifices and votive
  offerings have fallen off terribly of late. Why, I can remember
  the time when people offered us human sacrifices, no mistake
  about it, human sacrifices.  Think of that.
